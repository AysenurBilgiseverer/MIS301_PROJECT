                                A healthy diet is an adequate and balanced diet. 
                                For the regular and balanced functioning of the cells that make up our body, 
                                we must take sufficient amounts of nutrients, namely fats, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins and minerals. 
                                Our body needs all the nutrients. 
                                It is wrong to eat unilaterally, that is, to feed only with protein or carbohydrates. 
                                By eating a balanced diet, we also get important nutrients such as vitamins, minerals and fiber.

                            <p class="contentxt">
                                One of the main reasons people eat a healthy diet is to maintain a healthy weight or to lose weight.
                                Healthy eating habits can improve your heart health and common prevent heart diseases.
                                A healthy diet can help individuals make sure they have strong teeth and bones now and, in the future, thus preventing teeth decay and osteoporosis.
                                “You are what you eat.” If you eat a healthy, balanced diet, you will feel better and more energized.
                                Eating healthy increases blood flow to the brain.

                            <p class="contentxt">
                                In a healthy diet, the body's needs will be met by adequate and balanced nutrition from the food group in the daily food pyramid. 
                                For example, 5 servings of fruit daily meet the need for vitamin C, while 2-3 servings of dairy products are sufficient for calcium. 
                                For this reason, if you eat healthy, there is no need for additional vitamin drugs.

                                The Healthy Eating Pyramid is a simple visual guide to the types and proportion of foods that we should eat every day for good health.
                                It contains the five core food groups, plus healthy fats, according to how much they contribute to a balanced diet based on the Australian Dietary Guidelines.
